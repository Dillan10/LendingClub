## General Information
- Testing the learnings of python , numerical analytics
- What is the background of your project?
- Find the trend for defaulters
- Lending club case study dataset

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- 
- Interesting to see that people who usually describe in detail why they need the loan have high probability of repayment
- interest rate range between 5 and 24 and also we have outliers above 22.5 , we need to get rid of those if we plan to use any classification algorithm)

- The number of defaulters is high in 60 months tenure than 36 months tenure
